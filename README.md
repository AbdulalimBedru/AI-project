Here is a list of pretrained text-to-image models that we can use, categorized by their platforms and capabilities:

OpenAI
DALL·E 2:
Generates high-quality, photorealistic, or artistic images from text descriptions.
Capable of image inpainting and editing.
Available via OpenAI API or ChatGPT's image generation tool.
Hugging Face Models
Stable Diffusion:

Open-source, highly versatile.
Available in multiple versions (e.g., 1.5, 2.0).
Works well for artistic styles, photorealism, and fantasy art.
DeepAI Text-to-Image Generator:

General-purpose generator for creative visuals from text prompts.
DreamBooth (fine-tuned on Stable Diffusion):

Allows personalization of images with specific styles or characters.
Latent Diffusion Models (LDM):

The foundation for Stable Diffusion, trained for generating latent image representations.
Disco Diffusion:

A model optimized for producing abstract and surreal artwork.
Used extensively in generative art communities.
Google Research
Imagen:

State-of-the-art text-to-image model.
Focused on generating highly photorealistic and detailed images.
Not yet widely available for public use.
Parti (Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image Model):

Scalable autoregressive approach for high-resolution images.
DeepMind
Gato:
A generalist model that can handle multiple modalities, including text-to-image.
Runway ML
Stable Diffusion (fine-tuned versions):
Simplifies access to Stable Diffusion models with user-friendly interfaces.
Others
Artbreeder:

A hybrid tool for creating artistic portraits and landscapes from prompts.
BigGAN and BigGAN-Deep:

Generative Adversarial Networks specialized for high-resolution image synthesis.
Craiyon (formerly DALL·E Mini):

A lightweight, free-to-use model for casual text-to-image generation.
DeepAI Generator:

Online tool with a basic text-to-image model.
Pixray:

Supports multiple styles (artistic, photorealistic) and is customizable with settings.
Applications
Fine-tuning Models:
Models like DreamBooth or LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tune Stable Diffusion or similar models for specific datasets.
APIs:
Platforms like Hugging Face, Stability AI, and OpenAI provide APIs for integration.
Each model is tailored to different use cases (e.g., creativity, realism, surrealism), so the choice depends on your goals and resources.
